/*
	package peamodbus implements the modbus protocol for TCP networks.

# Glossary

  - MBAP: Modbus Application Protocol. Used to differentiate between Modbus RTU
    which is lower level in character.
  - ADU: Application Data Unit. Encapsulates the PDU packet of data and some additional
    fields that are introduced by nature of the underlying network used.
  - PDU: Protocol Data Unit. Refers to packet of data with function code and data
    associated with said function. This is data relevant to the Modbus system.
  - MBAP Header: This refers to the segment of data that precedes the PDU in a
    Modbus request or response over TCP/IP.

# MBAP Header

	2 bytes | Transaction Identifier
	2 bytes | Protocol Identifier. Is 0 for Modbus protocol
	2 bytes | Length. Number of following bytes in PDU
	1 byte  | Unit identifier: Identifies a remote slave connected on a serial line or other buses

# Modbus Data Model

	Data table type   | Structure  | Access     | Comments
	Discrete Inputs   | Single bit | Read-only  | Data provided by an IO system
	Coils             | Single bit | Read/Write | Alterable by application program
	Input Registers   | 16bit word | Read-only  | Data provided by an IO system
	Holding Registers | 16bit word | Read/Write | Alterable by application program
